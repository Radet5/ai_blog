When you think of castles, what comes to mind? Towers reaching up into the sky, walls that seem impenetrable, and courtyards with lush gardens? Maybe you envision a scene from The Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. Whatever your image, chances are it's steeped in medieval history. 
The Middle Ages were a time when castles dominated the landscape and manor houses (a type of castle) were some of the most impressive structures in Europe. These days, many people associate castles with movies like Agatha Christie or Robin Hood, but during the Middle Ages they were used as strongholds by feudal lords and played an important role in society. 
Castles served as homes for the wealthy and their families as well as military installations; they were also places where courts met to resolve disputes. In addition to being beautiful architectural creations, castles also played an important role in history: during the Crusades, for example, they were key locations where armies gathered before embarking on long journeys overseas. 
Today, there are still remnants of medieval castles scattered throughout Europe; some stand tall and proud while others have been restored and converted into museums or hotels. If you're planning a trip to one of these amazing sites (or even if you're not), be sure to take photos! Here are five examples that will give you an idea of what medieval castles look like: 
1) Château de Chinon in France is home to one of Europe's largest collections of châteaux—mansion-style buildings built for aristocrats during the Middle Ages. This particular château was built between 1220 and 1280 by King John II le Bon (who later became known as John Lackland). 
2) The Norman Keep at Caernarfon Castle is one of Wales' most iconic landmarks; it's part of a structure known as Prince's Gatehouse dating back to 1067 AD. It was originally constructed as part of a series of fortifications designed to protect Cardiff Bay from attack by sea forces Viking invaders. 
3) The Tower Bells at Cluny Abbey near Paris date back over 1,000 years and are among the oldest surviving bells in France; they're inscribed with prayers related to church services conducted inside Cluny Abbey during Medieval times. 
4) Gevgelija Palace in Macedonia is home to one of Europe's largest private art collections—including works by Titian, Michelangelo da Carpi da Siena, Raphael Sanzio da Urbino Florentine , Leonardo da Vinci , Hieronymus Bosch , El Greco , Johannes Vermeer , Vincent van Gogh , etc.—and it was once owned by Emperor Franz Joseph I .  5) Windsor Castle is probably most famous for its annual royal wedding ceremonies (which take place on June 19th each year), but it also features several other fascinating attractions including its Great Hall (built between 1536-1540), St George's Chapel (1495-1504), Queen Mary’s Dolls House (1758-1761), State Apartments & Staterooms (1837-1841), Balmoral Estate & Gardens (1854-1910)—the list goes on! So whether you're visiting England or another country within Europe that has preserved elements from this era—like Hungary or Romania—take lots photos so that you can share them online!
