The medieval castle was a fortification built to protect the inhabitants of a town or city. The first castles were built in the 9th and 10th centuries, and they reached their peak in the 12th and 13th centuries. These structures were designed to withstand attack by siege engines, and they had thick walls, strong gates, and high towers. In the 14th century, gunpowder changed the nature of warfare, and castles became less effective as defenses. However, many castles continued to be used as homes by nobles until the 18th century. Today, these historic sites are popular tourist attractions.

Castles were often built on strategic locations such as hilltops or near rivers. They usually had a moat—a deep ditch that was filled with water—to make it more difficult for attackers to get close to the castle walls. The first castles were made of wood, but later ones were constructed from stone. Stone castles were stronger than wooden ones and could better withstand attacks from siege engines like catapults.

Castles typically had several levels, with the living quarters located on the upper floors. The ground floor was used for storage or as stables for horses. The great hall was where people gathered for meals or entertainment. Castles also had chapels where Mass could be celebrated.

Most castles had a keep—a large tower that served as a last line of defense if enemies managed to breach the castle walls. The keep was also used as a residence by the lord of the castle and his family. Above the main entrance to the keep was a room called the solar where ladies would sew or read while their husbands conducted business in other parts of the castle.

The layout of a castle depended on its location and purpose—some were built for defense while others were meant primarily as residences for nobility—but all followed certain basic principles: thick walls, strong gates, high towers, and a central keep."
